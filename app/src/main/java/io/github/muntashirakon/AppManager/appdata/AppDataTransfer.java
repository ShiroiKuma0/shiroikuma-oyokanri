/**
 * Fork: everything the contract puts on 応用管理's side of the line, so that forty-two sister
 * apps do not each have to remember it.
 * <p>
 * Three guarantees live here:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Thaw, export, refreeze exactly what was thawed.</b> 270 packages are frozen on this
 *     phone, so this is the common path rather than an exception, and "Could not find provider"
 *     is overwhelmingly the freeze rather than a broken door.</li>
 * <li><b>Force-stop strictly after a successful import reply, never before it.</b> A running
 *     process writes its cached {@code SharedPreferences} back out at orderly shutdown and
 *     silently undoes the import that just happened. Ten sister repos now flush synchronously
 *     before replying {@code OK}, and that only works because the kill lands afterwards.</li>
 * <li><b>A battery-optimisation exemption around the call.</b> A foreground service started from
 *     a binder call is a background start and can be refused outright on API 31+ unless the app
 *     is exempt. That refusal is cured here, before the export, rather than discovered during
 *     one.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Every change is recorded <b>before</b> it is made, in its own preferences file, and reconciled
 * at next launch — a crash mid-export must not leave a batch of 白い熊's apps quietly running.
